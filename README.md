# Progress to Level
![](demo.webp)
## Description
XP levels do not scale linearly. Because of this, it can be difficult to asses exactly how much more XP you need to collect to reach level 30 for maximum level enchantments. This mod aims to make this progression more clear with a HUD element that shows the user's current progress to level 30 whenever they acquire XP.
## Technologies Used
- Code is written in Java
- Uses the Fabric Minecraft modding API
- Developed using IntelliJ and Gradle build system
